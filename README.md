# Zip CLI Tool

A simple command-line tool for reading and writing ZIP files, built as a learning project to understand the ZIP file format specification.

## About

This project is a work in progress as I explore and implement the ZIP file format from scratch. The goal is to build a functional CLI tool while gaining a deep understanding of how ZIP files work under the hood.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This tool is in early development. Features and functionality are being added incrementally as I learn more about the ZIP specification. It is absolutely not ready for production use unless you just want to read the contents of a zip file.

## Planned Features
- [ ] Add CLI commands for ZIP operations
- [x] Read ZIP file contents
- [ ] Extract files from ZIP archives
- [ ] Create new ZIP files
- [ ] Add files to existing ZIP archives
- [ ] List archive contents
- [ ] Support for compression methods
- [ ] Handle ZIP64 format for large files

- [Wikipedia: ZIP (file format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format))
- [PKZip Docs - jmu.edu](https://users.cs.jmu.edu/buchhofp/forensics/formats/pkzip.html)

*This README will be (hopefully) updated as the project develops and new features are implemented.*
